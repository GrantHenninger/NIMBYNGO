# NIMBYNGO

NIMBYNGO is an online interactive bingo-style game to play during public meetings. It can be played at http://www.nimbyngo.com.

## Current Status
Currently NIMBYNGO is only a mockup of what the final game will look like. 

## Development Roadmap
Next steps in development include:

- [ ] Create more winning sayings for the bingo cards. A list can be found at https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KXJoy0bfriZxw-h9ONcxTwPGnCdts_b_lsoYyg3y6iY/edit?usp=sharing
- [ ] Create a playable single person version of the game:
  - [X] Enable players to click on boxes to mark them off. (Inverse colors when clicked.)
  - [ ] Determine when a player has selected five in a row and declare they are a winner!
- [ ] Create a multiplayer experience:
  - [ ] Create a login system
  - [ ] Allow players to create new games, one for each public meeting, and allow other users to find existing games they can join.
  - [ ] Create a way for the game to send which boxes are selected by each player and determine who gets five in a row first.
